# The project has been cleaned! #
Yep, this page is dedicated to the N810 and its current state!
Its build for Qt/x11 this time, not Qtopia!

**A new branch with this will be created very soon**


# Status #

  * New layout automatically fits the screen size
  * Only Map tiles can be displayed (but expansion will be easy and fast now!)


## Short term Features+fixes ##
Here I write some changes I will add shortly (this page is actually more for myself!

  * MapControl window is as big as mainwindow (fixed)
  * OCM's configuration settings should be stored somewhere and it should be possible to change theM (like where the tiles are stored)
  * Dubbel klick will zoom.
  * Minimum and maximum zoom levels! (fixed)

## Slighty longer term Features+fixes ##
  * Re√Ømplent the good old features on a clean way from the Greenphone source code.
  * Make it more then just a map viewer!
