# Open Citymap #
Open CityMap is an application for Qtopia compatible devices like Windows CE, OpenMoko and so on. The project was started in Belgium in 2008 by two students of the De Nayer Institute. The development started on the GreenPhone, but a new era started since some of the developers got a Nokia N810 on Akademy 2008.

## Introduction ##
CityMap can be used to show free (open) street maps on your mobile device provided by OpenStreetMap. Both tiles and XML formatted OSM data can be used to display the maps. If the device is associated with a GPS receiver (internally or externally through bluetooth), it will also be possible to record GPX traces. Aside of displaying maps and tracking roads you can use the application to do some basic OSM tagging. Devices with the possibility to take pictures can use this to automatically get ExIF data included in the pictures. Another cool feature is the QtScript, this makes it possibility to write your own extensions for CityMap.

# Features #
